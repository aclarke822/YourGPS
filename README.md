# YourGPS
This project I started to spoof my location in Pokemon Go. I built every component including the ability to save routes, follow a route at a certain speed, randomization to make sure it couldn't be detected, etc... I didn't bother getting over the Android barrier that required rooting because I stopped playing the game. But everything works with the mock locations function. Games just won't accept that as your actual location. Fun project overall!
